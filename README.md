# Gender-Recognition-by-Voice-using-ANN
In this project, we aim to develop a voice gender classification model using machine learning techniques. The dataset used consists of voice samples with various acoustic features. A neural network model is built using TensorFlow and Keras to classify the voice samples as male or female. The model is trained and evaluated, achieving an accuracy of approximately 96%. Additionally, we implement a feature extraction function using the Librosa library for real-time audio file processing. This report details the methodology, implementation, and results of the project.
